            <li>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them?
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>I didn't have many problems completing this assignment. I just forgot how to do some stuff such as inserting image. I solved this issue by Googling.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>I didn't learn much from this assignment because I learned this before. This felt more like a reminder from what I did in high school.
                        I already knew how to do the basics like head, title, body, and paragraphs.</li>
                    <br>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I used websites such as w3schools and youtube to help complete this assignment. I ready what people had to say and watched videos on how to use them.</li>
                </ul>
